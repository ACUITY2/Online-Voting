Online-Voting
This is for those who are staying in different locations other than their allotted constituency.
AADHAAR Identity number is compulsory for every candidate.
we can create a software for the election commission of India. The software should have a access of all the details of the voter ID card and Aadhar card. We can verify the details of the voter ID card by matching with the aadhar card. The software will only be given to the government institutions like government colleges, miltary camp and municipal offices in that area. 
A person has to go there for voting process. The software will verify the details by scanning QR code on aadhar card and accordingly the software will find his constituency to which he belongs to and as soon as he votes, the vote will be counted from his contituency.The software will send information to the server computer which have folders of all the constituencies in India. 
As soon as the person votes an image(.jpeg) file (party logo) will be created and the vote will be counted as +1 for that party in that constituency and vote will be created with some random name(M01,M02), so that it cannot be identified in any case that who votes whom in that consitutency folder. We can adopt this process.
Then the server will send information to the respective constituency after the voting process is completed.
Only the election commision will have access to this software and also this software.
This Software can be created by using Microsoft Visual Studio.
